# Item Duplicate Check

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Allows to define rules in order to check while adding an item if it already exists in Omeka database.

## Rules and duplicates
A rule is a combination of an **Item Type** and one or more **Elements**. A rule applies to an Item only if its Item Type matches.

A duplicate is an Item which have the same values in the Elements defined in a rule as the Item is being added. When a duplicate is found, the Item is not saved and an error message is shown.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
