# Item Duplicate Check

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Allows to define rules in order to check while adding an item if it already exists in Omeka database.

## Rules and duplicates
A rule is a combination of an item type and one or more elements. A rule applies to an item only if its item type matches.

A duplicate is an item which have the same values in the elements defined in rule as the item being added. When a duplicate is found, the item is not saved and an error message is shown.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

It's always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
